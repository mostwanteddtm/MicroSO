CHECKVSA.LZH

CheckVESA is a simple assembler routine to check to see if the particular
computer running is VESA-compatible.

I wrote this code for a project that never got off the ground, so it
is hereby released into the public domain for all to use and steal.

No support is granted for it---take it and use it as much as you want.

Thanx all..
